# Identification of Digits from sign languages 


---

# Data 
- Use of 2062 images as a database, provided by Kaggle 
- Data includes all numbers from 0 to 9 with 10 labels 
- Use of Raw image data due to easier manipulation

# Data Preprocessing

- Changes preformed randomly:
  - rotate(-20ยบ to 20ยบ)
  - Gausian noise (0 to 0.05*255)
  - Gamma contrast(0.5 to 1.5)

With this changes for every image five new ones were made

---





# Image processing
- Use of images that were grayscale and flattened showed better results
- Split the dataset into training and testing
